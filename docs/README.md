benefits, and some common tools and concepts used in IT automation.
### Duration
90 minutes


### Prerequisites:

- Whiteboard and markers or a digital whiteboard tool
- Projector or screen for presentations
- Laptops or devices with internet access
- None


## Introduction
> "What repetitive tasks do you perform on your computer or smartphone regularly?"

### Infrastructure Automation
Explain that the lesson is about making these routine tasks easier and more efficient through
automation. Define infrastructure automation as the use of technology to streamline and automate
repetitive
processes in a systematic and efficient way.

### Understanding the Need for Automation
Discussion: Engage the students in a discussion about the drawbacks of manual processes and the benefits
of automation. Encourage them to share personal experiences or examples from their daily lives where
automation could be helpful.

### Key Concepts

- Infrastructure
- Automation
- Trigger
- Action
- Integration


## Infrastructure Diagram
Use a whiteboard or digital tool to draw a simple infrastructure diagram that illustrates how a trigger
leads
to an action in an automated process.

### Types of Automation
- Task automation
- (e.g., sending automatic email replies)
- Process automation
- (e.g., automating a software deployment process)
- Data automation
- (e.g., data extraction and transformation)


## Common Automation Tools (15 minutes)
### Overview: Introduce some popular automation tools and platforms, such as:

- Zapier
- Microsoft Power Automate
- IFTTT (If This Then That)
- Python scripting for automation

### Benefits of Different Tools
Explain how these tools are used for different purposes and the advantages of each.


### Hands-On Activity (15 minutes)
### Simple Automation Task
Divide the class into pairs or small groups. Provide them with laptops or devices and guide them through
a simple automation task using a tool like Zapier or IFTTT. For example, automating the process of
receiving an email notification when a specific keyword is mentioned on social media.

### Real-World Examples (10 minutes)
`Showcase`: Present a few real-world examples of how organizations have benefited from infrastructure
automation in areas like customer service, marketing, and IT operations.
Q&A and Discussion (10 minutes)


## Open Floor:
Encourage students to ask questions and participate in a discussion about infrastructure automation, the
tools
they learned about, and its potential applications.

### Conclusion
`Recap`: Summarize the key points covered in the lesson, emphasizing the importance and versatility of
infrastructure automation.

## Assessment
Assess students based on their participation in discussions, the completion of the hands-on activity,
and their understanding of the key concepts presented during the lesson.

## Additional Resources
Provide students with links to online tutorials and resources for further exploration of infrastructure
automation and relevant tools.

This lesson plan provides a solid introduction to infrastructure automation, setting the stage for more
advanced concepts and practical applications in future lessons.
